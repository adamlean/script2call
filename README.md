# Script2Call

**Script2Call** is an open-source tool designed for call center operators.
Many call centers still store scripts in Word files or Google Docs, which makes work slow and inconvenient. This tool allows you to transfer scripts to a convenient interface with categories, which significantly speeds up work and reduces fatigue.

## What we plan to implement

1. **Script manager**
- Ability to import text files to avoid manual script entry.
2. **Voice templates**
- Recording of the operator's voice with the ability to assign keys. This will allow you to include pre-recorded phrases and reduce the strain on your vocal cords. Anyone who has worked 4-6 hours straight in a call center will understand.
3. **Time tracker blocker**
- Masking activity in employer monitoring systems to reduce pressure and increase comfort at work.
4. **Modular architecture**
- The interface will support plugins and widgets to extend functionality for custom tasks.

## Note
Development is carried out in my spare time and is not a priority. However, the planned features will be implemented gradually.
